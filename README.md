Hello, 
This was my first data analysis project. A few year ago my grand ma had a brain stroke so bad that she couldnÂ´t move half of her body without assistance.
This proyect was inspire in her, we explore if there is an statistically significative asociation between different variables like hypertension, heart disease, 
average glucose levels, bmi, gender, age, type of work, residence type, smoking status and stroke
